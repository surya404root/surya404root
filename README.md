### Security-Focused Developer • Ethical Hacking Learner • Linux / Termux Enthusiast

---

## 👋 Welcome
Hi, I’m **Surya** — a developer who believes that **good security starts with good code**.

I’m on a learning journey to understand **how systems work, how they fail, and how they can be protected**.  
My interest in ethical hacking comes from **curiosity, responsibility, and defense**, not misuse.

> 💬 *“To defend a system, you must first understand how it can be attacked.”*

---

## 🧠 My Mindset
I approach cybersecurity with three core principles:

- 🔐 **Security First** — code should be safe by default  
- ⚖️ **Ethics Always** — learning only on legal & permission-based systems  
- 📚 **Foundations Matter** — strong basics before advanced tools  

I don’t rush for shortcuts. I build knowledge **step by step**, the right way.

---

## 🔍 What I’m Learning & Exploring
- Secure programming practices  
- How common vulnerabilities work (theory & prevention)  
- Defensive coding techniques  
- Linux & Termux environments  
- How attackers think — to **stop them**

⚠️ All learning is **educational**, **lab-based**, and **self-owned systems only**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Skills (Growing Daily)
- **Python 🐍**  
  - Secure scripting  
  - Error handling & validation  
  - Automation with safety  

- **Web Basics 🌐**  
  - HTML (structure & clarity)  
  - CSS (clean layouts)  
  - JavaScript (logic & input checks)  

- **Linux / Termux 🐧**  
  - Command-line tools  
  - Environment control  
  - Script execution  

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals 🔐**  
  - Vulnerability awareness  
  - Defensive thinking  
  - Ethical hacking concepts  

---

## 📂 Projects & Practice
I focus on **small but meaningful projects**, including:

- 🧪 Secure Python mini-tools  
- 🔒 Input-safe scripts  
- 🧠 Cybersecurity learning notes  
- 🐧 Termux practice labs  

More projects are always in progress 🚧  
Quality > quantity.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goals
- Become a **professional security developer**
- Contribute to **open-source security projects**
- Build tools that **help protect users**
- Deeply understand systems before exploiting theory
- Grow into **responsible cybersecurity roles**

---

## 🧩 Why Cybersecurity?
Because technology is powerful — and **power needs responsibility**.

I believe hackers should:
- Protect, not exploit  
- Educate, not harm  
- Build, not destroy  

Cybersecurity is not about breaking rules.  
It’s about **protecting what matters**.

## ⚠️ Ethical Statement
All repositories, scripts, and experiments here are created **strictly for educational purposes** and are tested only on:
- Self-owned systems  
- Legal labs  
- Environments with explicit permission  

🚫 No illegal activity is supported or encouraged.
